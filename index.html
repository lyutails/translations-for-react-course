  <h1>Week 1</h1>
  <h2>React. Components</h2>
  <div class="wrapper_section_1">
    <p>Should be done:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create separate branch for this task.</li>
      <li>Use CRA with template --typescript.</li>
      <li>Set up eslint and prettier so that project would not build if having errors. Use configs https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/react/modules/module01/configs.md [RU]</li>
      <li>Add React-Router version 6. Add header showing current page, also add pages “About Us”, “404”. If trying to
        input unknown route into url – application should redirect to “404”.</li>
      <li>Draw the following on the main page:
        <ul>
          <li>Search Bar.
            examples:
            https://studio.uxpincdn.com/studio/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/BlogHeader_SearchBar_1200x600.png
            https://www.sliderrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cssheader1.jpg
            Input value should be saved to LocalStorage during component’s unmount. While initializing this component
            look
            at LocalStorage value and show it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cards. The more details are on the card – the better.
            examples:
            https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/cdn-origin/uploads/2017/01/behance.jpg
            https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/cdn-origin/uploads/2017/01/rightmove.jpg
            https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/cdn-origin/uploads/2017/01/awwwards.jpg
            In the situation when the access to life cycles of component is needed or there is a necessity of state –
            use
            class components. Using hooks is forbidden at this stage.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Add tests for components. Mock LocalStorage. Add test for one card, as well as tests for the list of all
        cards.
        Usage of Testing Library React or Enzyme is allowed, but only one of them. Preferred Testing Library React. 
        </br>All logical parts should be set into separate components.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
